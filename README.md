# Overview of Python Scripts Here

## Overview
This repo contains the automation scripts which I have completed from scratch providing great value to organisations for their repeatibility and utility.

1. aws-environment-cleanup - Deletes many different resources based on corresponding tags & conditions utilising the Boto3 client.
2. behave-tag-generation - Automates the generation of Behave tagging based on Terraform feature flags with hierarchical considerations for modules.
3. k8s-evacuation - Handles the evacuation of an AZ for worker nodes within AWS subnets, cordoning and draining the nodes smoothly.
4. kibana-indexing - Script to index Kibana clusters annd calculate the size of corresponding data to optimise resize during cluster migration.

Further details for each Python project can be found within the corresponding folder.
